# routing guide

this project appears to use both the newer next.js app router and the legacy pages router.

## app router (newer)

the app router components are located in the `/app` directory:

- [app/auth](mdc:app/auth): authentication related pages
- [app/profile](mdc:app/profile): user profile pages
- [app/settings](mdc:app/settings): settings pages
  - [app/settings/product/[id]](mdc:app/settings/product/[id]): dynamic route for product settings

## pages router (legacy)

the legacy pages router components are located in the `/pages` directory:

- [pages/Auth](mdc:pages/Auth): authentication pages
- [pages/Home](mdc:pages/Home): home page
- [pages/product](mdc:pages/product): product detail pages

when creating new routes, prefer using the app router structure unless you have a specific reason to use the legacy pages router.
