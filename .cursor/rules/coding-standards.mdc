# coding standards

## typescript

this project uses typescript. all new code should be properly typed.

## naming conventions

- use camelCase for variables and function names
- use PascalCase for component names and type definitions
- use kebab-case for file names of non-component files
- use PascalCase for component file names

## components

- each component should be in its own directory with an index.ts(x) file
- keep components focused on a single responsibility
- extract reusable logic into custom hooks when appropriate

## styles

global styles are in the `/styles` directory. component-specific styles should be co-located with their components.

## logging and comments

- all logs and console messages should be in lowercase
- all comments in code should be in lowercase
- markdown documentation should be in lowercase
- maintain proper code identifier casing (variable names, component names, etc.)

## utility functions

reusable utility functions should be placed in the `/utils` directory and properly exported.
